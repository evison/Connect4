has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect..." error), just follow the
following steps:
1. Install the two package include: vcredist_x86 _vc8.exe and vcredist_x86 _vc8.exe
2. Copy the files included in the dll directory to the directory where Compete.exe is, or to the 
directory that is included in your system-wise environment variables.

请按照如下方法操作：
1.安装里面的两个发布包vcredist_x86 _vc8.exe和vcredist_x86 _vc8.exe
2.将里面dll文件夹下的文件拷贝到Compete.exe所在的目录下，或你的环境变量所指定的目录下。
